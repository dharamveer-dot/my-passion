## Namastey 🙏 I'm Dharam!
The motto of my life is to be determined towards the software world and its development for the betterment in the standard of living of the society.

My **Passion** is Travel. Travelling helps me connect with new people, which helps to improve my interpersonal skills. We meet people from various races, regions. It helps to understand their background and connect with them. 
This acquired skill helps when we work with a distributed global team. Travelling makes me *independent* and build my **confidence**. It's like food for the soul which is necessary to de-stress. **Travel is like a fresh dose of much  oxygen**.
